  Sand is poured in a truck. In the truck x m^3 of sand can be placed. There are in total n kinds of sand. The input data is n (1 <= n <= 100000) and x, and then n pairs of numbers a and b which describe
  a certain type of sand. a is the amount of sand in m^3 which we have, while b is the total value of the a m^3 of sand. The truck should be loaded so that the total value inside it is as large
  as possible. From every type of sand we can take as much m^3 as we want (we don't have to always take the entire a).

  The solution here is the book's solution. It is a greedy solution.
