  Exercise taken from from KusaliÄ‡, D. (2012). Napredno programiranje i algoritmi u C-u i C++-u (3rd ed.). Element. Page 249

  In the first line there are three numbers: n (1 <= n <= 200), m (1 <= m <= n * n) and x (0 <= x < n). n is the number of nodes and m is the number of the edges in the graph.
  We then input 3 numbers a, b (0 <= a,b < n) and c (-1000 <= c <= 1000) m times. a and b are 0-indexed nodes connected with a directed edge (from a to b) with weight c.
  Print out the shortest distance from the node x to every other node (every node will be reachable from x) or ERR if there is a negative cycle.

  The solution here is from the book.
