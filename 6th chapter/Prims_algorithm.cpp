  Exercise taken from from KusaliÄ‡, D. (2012). Napredno programiranje i algoritmi u C-u i C++-u (3rd ed.). Element. Page 257

  A little country wants to connect its cities by building roads between them. The goal is that all the cities are connected with as little cost as possible.
  There is n cities in total and there is a plan for building m roads from which some have to be chosen to actually be built. 
  The input data in the first line have the numbers n (1 <= n <= 1000) and m (1 <= m <= n^2).
  Then there's m times a triple of a, b, (0 <= a,b < n) and c (1 <= c <= 1000) which describe a plan for building a two-way road between cities a and b which cost c money.
  Print out the least expensive way to connect all n cities (all cities will be connectable).

  The goal of this task is to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm.

  The solution here is mine (before looking at the book's solution).

  Note: This solution is O(n^3), but it works. If I wanted the solution to be O(n^2) (where n is the number of edges), I'd have to rethink my program design. In the book the solution is implemented
	in O(n^2).
