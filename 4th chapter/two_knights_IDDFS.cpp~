  Implementation taken from from KusaliÄ‡, D. (2012). Napredno programiranje i algoritmi u C-u i C++-u (3rd ed.). Element. Page 175

  Input the numbers a, b, c and d (1 <= a, b, c, d <= 8) which represent two locations of knights on a chessboard. Then input x (1 <= x < 10) and check 
  whether the knight at the field (a, b) can come to the field (c, d) in x or less moves.

  I wrote this before looking at the book's solution. After that, I added the corrections as indicated in the comments. The book also uses memoization in its solution.
