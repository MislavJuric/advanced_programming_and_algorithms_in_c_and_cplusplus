  Two numbers, n and m (1 <= n, m <= 1000) are inputted, which represent the dimensions of a plan of a city which is being inputted.
  After that n lines with m characters is inputted which represent the outline of the city. The inputted characters can be either '.', 'X', 'o' or '-'.
  '.' represents a road, 'X' represents a building, 'o' is food (burek) and '-' is the Hungry. You can walk on roads ('.'), but you can't walk on buildings ('X').
  The Hungry can move up, down, left and right through the city.
  Print the maximum number of food (bureks) the Hungry can eat and what is the least amount of steps that the Hungry must make so that he can come from
  the starting location to every food (burek) he can eat. 

  Note: The "least amount of steps" is actually the food which has the most distance from the Hungry's starting position.

  This is the book's solution.
