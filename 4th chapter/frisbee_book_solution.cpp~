  Numbers are arranged in a circle and they are passing frisbee. n is inputted (1 <= n <= 1000) and after that n natural numbers
  less than 10^9. Second number is to the right of the first one, third number is to the right of the second one etc.
  The first number is to the right of the last one. At the beginning the first number has the frisbee. If the first number is 5, then he will
  step out of the circle and pass the frisbee to the 5th number to its right. The number who gets the frisbee will step out of the circle and
  pass it to the x-th element to the right, if its value is . Numbers leave the circle and toss the frisbee. Print the numbers in the order
  they left the circle.

  This is the book's solution.
