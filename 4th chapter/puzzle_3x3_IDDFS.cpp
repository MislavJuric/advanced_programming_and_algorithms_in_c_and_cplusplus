  Solve a 3x3 puzzle using a minimum number of moves. During that print all states of the puzzle in reverse order. Puzzle 3x3 needs to be folded in the following shape:

  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9

  You can use 4 diffent types of rotations. With a rotation 4 nubmers which are adjecent to each other (2x2 square) are replaced in a clockwise direction.

  I.e. from:

  9 8 7
  6 5 4
  3 2 1

  you can go to:
  
  6 9 7    9 5 8    9 8 7    9 8 7
  5 8 4    6 4 7    3 6 4    6 2 5
  3 2 1    3 2 1    2 5 1    3 1 4

  This solution is mine; I wrote it before looking at the book's solution. The book suggested using IIDFS, so I used that.
