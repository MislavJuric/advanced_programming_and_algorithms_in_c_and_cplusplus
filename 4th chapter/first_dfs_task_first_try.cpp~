  Exercise taken from from KusaliÄ‡, D. (2012). Napredno programiranje i algoritmi u C-u i C++-u (3rd ed.). Element. Page 170

  Write out the steps needed to arrange a 2D array that is 2x3 to this:

  1 2 3
  4 5 6

  The solution generated here is mine, before looking at the book's solution.
*/

/*
  My general procedure:
  
  1. Create a vector of 2x3 arrays
  2. In the recursion, remember all of the 2x3 arrays
  3. Check if the current 2x3 is the solution
  4a. If not, change the configuration and see if you already have it in the vector of 2x3 arrays
  4b. If you have it in the vector, don't recurse - change another thing (before changing it revert the 2x3 back to its original at the start of the recursion)
  4c. If you don't have it in the vector, recurse
